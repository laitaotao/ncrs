Our code is based on the framework of [1]. The code is an example for 3D motion segmentation by using homography matrix. More details about the use of the code please see readme-2.txt.
The order of performing the code is as follows：
1. script_Fundamental_Hypo_mMultiSamp
2. script_Fundamental_ORK_RandSamp
3. script_Fundamental_MoSeg_RandSamp
4. script_Fundamental_CheckPerf_RandSamp
